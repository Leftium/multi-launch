# MultiSearch

[Return to app](/)

## How to Use

1. Enter a query into the text area.
2. Press one of the buttons.
3. Results will open in new tabs.

## Tips

-   The blue 'All' buttons open multiple tabs. You may need to allow pop-ups from your browser. (Not supported in mobile Safari.)
-   The <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key acts like pressing 'All Translate.' (Use <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>ENTER</kbd> to insert a newline.)
-   The Translate buttons automatically detect Korean/English.
-   Some of the image buttons support reverse image search. Just enter the URL of an image.
-   You can paste a query even when focus is outside the text area.
-   You don't need to close all the tabs one at a time:
    -   Right-click a tab, then "Close other tabs" or "Close tabs to the right"
    -   Or just close the browser window while another browser window is open.
